#### ALL CODE IN THIS REPOSITORY WAS PRODUCED AS A RAPID PROTOTYPE, SOME EVOLVED INTO PARTIAL PROJECTS, SOME EVOLVED INTO FULL PROTJECTS, IN ALMOST ALL CASES THIS CODE RELEASED WITH PERMISSION, NO FURTHER DEVOLOPMENT WAS DONE BY ME. THE PROJECT MAINTAINERS HAVE EVOLVED THE APPLICATIONS SO FAR THEY HAVE LITTLE TO NO RESEMBLANCE TO THE CODE REPRESENTED HERE. AS I SAID THE CODE HERE IS RAPID PROTOTYPES, USUALLY CREATED IN LESS THAN A DAY, AND SIMPLY PROOVE SOMETHING CAN BE DONE.
