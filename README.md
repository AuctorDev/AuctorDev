- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @AuctorDev
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in all things IT related 

I write code mainly for personal use, i am **NOT** a professional devoloper, and none of the code in this repository should be considered for use in production


Your welcome to use any code you find here how you see fit, but i ask you to submit pull requests if you do use the code and make changes, this will allow me to learn and improve the code i do write!
